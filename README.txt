# Network Security Automation Project

This project aims to automate the process of securing networks by providing a set of scripts and tools that can be used to monitor and configure network devices.
It will be only used for our on-prem devices for now. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Visual Studio Code / PyCharm
- A list of network devices with IP addresses and login credentials
- Make sure you can ssh to all the boxes from your system for the codes to work.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python packages and visual studio code or Pycharm.

### Usage

1. For most of the code added, your privileged id will work. For Backbox use 'root' credentials from the Vault and for checkpoint use username 'admin' and expert password.
   All the show commands will be executed as in clish mode even though we login as an expert. 

2. The scripts can be run locally and it is upto the individual using to decide when to execute them independently.
